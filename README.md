# LotteryGame

# Instructions
To run the code Java must be installed. The driver has the instantiations of the classes used in the lottery games, including examples using them.
The user can replace and change the values as they wish to play the games.

This project was built around the UML diagram which can be found in this repo. It follows the software development strategy "Generics" in order to use the same method for arrays
which contain the chance values.
